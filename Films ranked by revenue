Here is a SQL query for films ranked by revenue:

SELECT 	A.title AS film_name,			
        C.name AS genre,		
        A.rental_rate,
        A.rating,
        A.language_id,
        A.release_year,
        SUM(F.amount) AS total_revenue		
FROM film A				
INNER JOIN film_category B ON A.film_id = B.film_id				
INNER JOIN category C ON B.category_id = C.category_id				
INNER JOIN inventory D ON A.film_id = D.film_id				
INNER JOIN rental E ON D.inventory_id = E.inventory_id				
INNER JOIN payment F ON E.rental_id = F.rental_id				
GROUP BY A.title, 
        C.name, 
        A.rental_rate,
        A.rating,
        A.language_id,
        A.release_year
ORDER BY SUM(F.amount) DESC;
